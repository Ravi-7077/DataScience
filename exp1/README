Titanic Survival Analysis — Tableau Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze the historical Titanic passenger dataset.
The goal of this project is to understand the factors influencing passenger survival, uncover patterns in demographics, and visually communicate the relationships between age, gender, ticket class, and survival outcomes.

Project Overview

This dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of:

Survival rates based on gender and passenger class

Age distribution among survivors and non-survivors

Family influence (Siblings/Spouses and Parents/Children onboard)

Fare patterns and their relationship to survival

Overall demographic analysis of passengers

Designed for clear storytelling, the dashboard helps users visually explore why certain groups had a higher chance of survival.

Key Insights

Replace with your own, but here are strong example insights:

Females had significantly higher survival rates compared to males.

1st-class passengers survived at a much higher rate than 2nd or 3rd class.

Children (Age < 15) showed better chances of survival, supporting “women and children first.”

Higher fares were correlated with better survival chances.

Passengers traveling alone tended to have lower survival rates.
